                Pune is known for its beauty due to its unique blend of tradition and modernity, with a moderate climate, green spaces, and surrounding hills. It's the "Queen of the Deccan," offering a mix of historic forts, colonial architecture, and a vibrant cultural scene, alongside being a major IT and automotive hub. The city's beauty is also found in its rich historical significance as the former capital of the Maratha Empire, its numerous educational institutions, and the diverse flora and fauna in its surrounding areas.
